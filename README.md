# **OblivionOPMod** #

The OblivionOPMod is currently a recoded version from **TotalFreedomMod**, for DaPancake's server OblivionOP, recoded just using the me.stevenlawson.totalfreedommod sources to make the coding work and recoding all commands, taking 13 months in total to complete, now licensed and has all rights, any person who fails to follow the license, this can not be given out, you can give out the source, not jars, if you get caught, you will be forced to delete all places you have it. You can see the OblivionOP Fourms at (In Development) And you can see the TFM Github here. http://github.com/TotalFreedom/totalfreedommod If you have any problems ask our devs and our helpers. Feel free to commit. Also, there won't be any public distributed releases just yet for the OblivionOP By DaPancake. Please watch the OblivionOP Boards for more info.
